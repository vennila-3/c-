INTRO: 
   C++ is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays for competitive programming.
       general purpose programming language:They include procedural, functional and object-oriented programming languages, including scripting and/or dynamically typed languages. Examples of general-purpose programming languages include C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby and Visual Basic.
   It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language.
   C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.).

Applications of C++: 
    C++ finds varied usage in applications such as:

    Operating Systems & Systems Programming. e.g. Linux-based OS (Ubuntu etc.)
    Browsers (Chrome & Firefox)
    Graphics & Game engines (Photoshop, Blender, Unreal-Engine)
    Database Engines (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis etc.)
    Cloud/Distributed Systems


    Cross-platform Compatibility: 
          C++ can be compiled and run on multiple platforms, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux, making it a versatile language for developing cross-platform applications.

 Advantages of C++:
      Performance: C++ is a compiled language, which means that its code is compiled into machine-readable code, making it one of the fastest programming languages.
      Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, which makes it easier to write and maintain large, complex applications.
      Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a wide range of algorithms and data structures for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.
      Machine Independent: C++ is not tied to any hardware or processor. If the compiler compiles the program in the system, it will be able to run no matter what the hardware is.
      Large Community: C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, providing a wealth of resources and support for learning and using the language.


Disadvantages of C++:
     The pointers that are used in C++ take up a lot of memory which is not always suitable for some devices
     Object-orientated programming languages have several security issues which means that programs written in C++ arenâ€™t as safe as others

FEATURES OF C++
  Object-Oriented Programming
  Machine Independent
  Simple
  High-Level Language
  Popular
  Case-sensitive
  Compiler Based
  Dynamic Memory Allocation
  Memory Management
  Multi-threading


// C++ program to display "Hello World"

// Header file for input output functions
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Main() function: where the execution of
// program begins
int main()
{
	// Prints hello world
	cout << "Hello World";

	return 0;
}

Preprocessors are programs that process the source code before compilation. 
Types of C/C++ Preprocessors

There are 4 Main Types of Preprocessor Directives:  
Macros
File Inclusion
Conditional Compilation
Other directives

When we import a namespace we are essentially pulling all type definitions into the current scope.
The std namespace is huge. The alternative to this statement is to specify the namespace to which the identifier belongs using the scope operator(::)each time we declare a type.
