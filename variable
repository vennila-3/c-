variable definition 
       A variable definition is a part where the variable is assigned a memory location and a value int a=10;
variable declaration
         The variable declaration refers to the part where a variable is first declared or introduced before its first use  int a;


Types of Variables
      There are three types of variables based on the scope of variables in C++
           Local Variables
           Instance Variables
           Static Variables
constants
    The constants in C are the read-only variables whose values cannot be modified once they are declared in the C program.
    const int int_const = 25;
   TYPES:
       Integer Constant
       Character Constant
       Floating Point Constant
       Double Precision Floating Point Constant
       Array Constant
      Structure Constant

ENUM:
   Enumeration (or enum) is a user defined data type in C and C++. It is mainly used to assign names to integral constants, that make a program easy to read and maintain.
CONSTEXP:
     Using constexpr in C++(not in C) can be used to declare variable as a guaranteed constant. But it would fail to compile if its initializer isnâ€™t a constant expression.
     #include <iostream> 
     int main() 
     { 
	  int var = 5;              //error var is an integer constexp is consonant
	  constexpr int k = var; 
	  std::cout << k; 
	  return 0; 
} 

SCOPE
        Global Scope
        Local Scope


SCOPE VS LIFETIME
       The scope of the variable is the region where it is valid to refer to the variable using its name.
      The lifetime of the variable is the time between it is allocated memory and it is deleted from the memory.
